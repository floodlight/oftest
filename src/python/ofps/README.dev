Rob's NOTES
-------------------------------

THREADING:

single process: four threads
* controller thread -- talks to controller, runs select(), does OF msg framing
    * changes pipeline config
    * processes stats requests
* dataplane -- monitors all interfaces for new packets, runs select(); 
    * queues packets to pipeline thread
* pipeline -- processes packets through ofps flow tables
    * e.g., pkt rewriting, pushing out to interfaces
* ofps main thread: controller for other threads (optional?)



USEFUL TESTING COMMANDS:

for i in 1 2 3 4 ; do 
    sudo ip link add type veth
done

for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ; do
    sudo ifconfig veth$i 192.168.10$i.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
done
